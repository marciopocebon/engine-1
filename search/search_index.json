See the setup documentation for more details. After starting the server, you will get entities spawned in the world. You can use e.g. the ai remote debugger ( src/tools/rcon ) to inspect the state or use the client to connect. To specify the database that should be used use the config bars db_name , db_host , db_pw and db_user . For example: ./vengi-server -set db_host 192.168.0.1 -set db_post 5432 -db_name vengi -db_pw engine For the client connect you need a user in the database. You can create users with a server command called sv_createuser . To get a list of available commands, you can use cmdlist in the server terminal. Chunk download The chunks are persisted in the database and can be made available via cdn or any other http server. The gameserver has a built-in http server, too. If you want to use any other http server, you have to set it via sv_httpchunkurl like this: ./vengi-server -set sv_httpchunkurl http://myhostname:8080/mychunkurl ... or export the environment variable SV_HTTPCHUNKURL or add it to your config file (see setup documentation for more details). This cvar is one of those that is automatically replicated to the client. Whenever you change it, all clients will be notified about it and use the new url.

This command expects the lua script filename ( .lua can be omitted) and the additional arguments for the main() method. Calling xs <script> help will print the supported arguments for the given script. There are two functions in each script. One is called arguments and one main . arguments returns a list of parameters for the main function. The default parameters for main are volume , region and color . color is the palette index starting from 0 . Example without parameters function main(volume, region, color) local mins = region:mins() local maxs = region:maxs() for x = mins.x, maxs.x do for y = mins.y, maxs.y do for z = mins.z, maxs.z do volume:setVoxel(x, y, z, color) end end end end Execute this via console xs scriptfile Example with one parameter function arguments() return { { name = 'n', desc = 'height level delta', type = 'int', default = '2' } } end function main(volume, region, color, n) [...] end Execute this via console xs scriptfile 1 where 1 will be the value of n . Omitting the 1 will add the default value from the argument list. LayerManager layerMgr lets you access different layers or create new ones. The functions are: new(name, visible, region) : Creates a new layer with the given name , the visible boolean, and the given size and position according to the region . get([layerId]) : Returns the layer for the given layerId - if the layerId is not given, it will return the current active layer. Which by default is the layer for the volume the script is currently executed for. Layer name() : Returns the current name of the layer. volume() : Gives you access to the volume of the layer. Color palette has several methods to work with colors. E.g. to find a closest possible match for the given palette index. The functions are: color(paletteIndex) : Pushes the vec4 of the color behind the palette index ( 0-255 ) as float values between 0.0 and 1.0 . colors() : Returns the palette RGBA colors as vec4 values. match(r, g, b) : Returns the closest possible palette color match for the given RGB ( 0-255 ) color. The returned palette index is in the range 0-255 . This value can then be used for the setVoxel method. similar(paletteindex, [coloramount]) : Return a table with similar colors given by their palette index. Region mins() : The lower boundary of the region (inclusive). maxs() : The upper boundary of the region (inclusive). setMins(mins) : The lower boundary of the region - given as ivec3 . setMaxs(maxs) : The upper boundary of the region - given as ivec3 . x() : The lower x boundary of the region. y() : The lower y boundary of the region. z() : The lower z bounary of the region. width() : The width of the region measured in voxels. height() : The height of the region measured in voxels. depth() : The depth of the region measured in voxels. Volume voxel(x, y, z) : Returns the palette index of the voxel at the given position in the volume [0-255] . Or -1 if there is no voxel. region() : Return the region of the volume. setVoxel(x, y, z, color) : Set the given color at the given coordinates in the volume. color must be in the range [0-255] . Vectors Available vector types are vec2 , vec3 , vec4 and their integer types ivec2 , ivec3 , ivec4 . local v1 = ivec3.new(1, 1, 1) There are 3 possible components for this vector. You can also call ivec3.new(1) to fill all three values with a one. Or call it like this: ivec3.new(1, 2) to create a vector with the three components of 1, 2, 2 . Other y going upwards. You have access to the cvar and cmd lua bindings, too. This means that you can access any cvar value or execute any command like layeradd or layermerge to modify the whole scene. cmd.execute(\"echo test\") var.int(\"cl_gamma\") To get a full list of commands and cvars use the console command cmdlist and cvarlist .
